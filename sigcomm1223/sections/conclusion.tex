\section{Conclusion}

In this paper we find that in VR video display, user perceived quality is very different from video quality itself because it is related to many human visual characteristics, and optimizing perceived quality can bring out 50\% bandwidth saving.

To solve the challenges of perceived quality measurement, bandwidth efficiency problem in video tiling, and client-side perceived quality real-time computation, we build PQVRS, a real-world VR streaming system. In PQVRS, we decouple perceived quality optimization to client-side and server-side, to build a perceived quality measurement model, a server-side video tiling algorithm and a client-side perceived quality real-time computation algorithm.

Experimental results show that PQVRS saves 45\% bandwidth while providing the same perceived quality, compared with state-of-the-art VR streaming systems.
